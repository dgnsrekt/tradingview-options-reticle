## (QAP) Quick Action Put Mode

This style of reticle is not visual until you flip the chart.

The advantage of the (QAP) is that it maintains the same appearance as the normal style of reticle, making contract targeting feel the same.

When targeting with (QAP) mode, be aware that the chart prices are reversed.

Up is down and down is up.

This can be confusing at first but will feel normal overtime.

Activate QAP mode by appending a 0- to the charts symbol.

example

If nothing appears that means no put option data was found for that symbol.
