QAP
Quick Action Put QAP-2000 Reticle

This style of reticle is not visual until you flip the chart. The advantage of the (QAP) reticle is that it always maintains the same appearance as a Smooth Action Call Reticle, making put targeting feel the same. When targeting with the (QAP) mode, be aware that the chart prices are reversed. Up is down and down is up. This can be confusing at first but will feel normal overtime.

Activate QAP mode by changing the appending a 0- to the charts symbol. If nothing appears that means there is no put option data for that symbol.
