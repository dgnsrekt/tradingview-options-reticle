This style of reticle is not visual until you flip the chart. The advantage of the (QAP) reticle is that it always maintains the same appearance as a Smooth Action Call Reticle, making put targeting feel nearly the same. When targeting with (QAP) mode, be aware that the chart prices are inversed. This can be confusing at first but will feel normal overtime.

Activate QAP mode by changing the appending a 0- to the charts symbol. If nothing appears that means there is no put option data for that symbol.
