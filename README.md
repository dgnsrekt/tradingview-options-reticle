## (QAP) Quick Action Put Reticle

This style of reticle is not visual until you flip the chart. The advantage of the (QAP) reticle is that it always maintains the same appearance as a Normal Call Reticle, making targeting feel the same. When targeting with the (QAP) mode, be aware that the chart prices are reversed. Up is down and down is up. This can be confusing at first but will feel normal overtime.

Activate QAP mode by changing the appending a 0- to the charts symbol. If nothing appears that means no put option data for that symbol was collected.

Power Flip Mode (PFM)
The Power Flip Mode is not visual until you flip the chart. The advantage of the (PFM) reticle is that it always maintains the same appearance as a Bull Call Reticle, making put targeting feel nearly the same. When targeting with (QAP) mode, be aware that the chart prices are inversed. This can be confusing at first but will feel normal overtime.
Activate QAP mode by changing the appending a 0- to the charts symbol. If nothing appears that means there is no put option data for that symbol.

CALIBRATING THE OVERLAY
Each Overlay is automatically set using the [FDD] Options adjustment script. The adjustment script will parse a watchlist exported from TradingView then download quote and option data for each ticker.  To maximize watchlist capacity the adjustment script will create a reticle overlay for every 200 tickers. 
RETICLE MOUNTING
To achieve the best accuracy each Overlay has the symbol set and process date in the title. 2020.12.31
